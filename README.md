# Optimistic horoscope
Everytime you have stroll through internet you will open
a place that seems to predict your current live or situation.
It is called the [barnum-effect](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum-Effekt). According to the wikipedia-article people are tending to believe in vague statements about themself and thinking its real. (By the way I'm not judging, I only summarize the article)
So why not give always an optimistic suggestion. This horoscope is planned to do it this way. For every astrological sign.

The functions of this web-application will be soon filled.
